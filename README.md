# ⚡ AI Browser Agent

**HopHacks 2025 – Bloomberg Social Good Track**  
*An AI browsing assistant that automates web tasks — from searching to form-filling — to boost efficiency for everyone.*

---

## 🚀 Inspiration
The web is powerful, but navigating it is often **slow and repetitive** — typing queries, clicking through menus, filling out forms. We wanted to build an AI agent that **interacts with the browser like a human**, saving time and effort while keeping the user in control.

## ✨ What It Does
- 🎤 **Dual Input Modes**  
  - Voice for hands-free productivity  
  - Text for traditional workflows  
- 🔊 **Adaptive Output**  
  - Speaks results if voice was used  
  - Returns text if typed  
- 🌐 **Web Agent Integration**  
  - Searches the web, extracts answers, fills forms, navigates sites  
- 👀 **Transparent Execution**  
  - Displays real-time browsing actions step-by-step  

---

## 🛠️ How We Built It
- **Frontend:** Javascript interface with voice & text controls  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Browser Agent for navigation & automation  
- **Speech Tech:** Whisper API (STT), Web Speech API (TTS)  
- **Integration:** Conditional response handling to match input mode  

---

## ⚡ Challenges
- Synchronizing **real-time speech + browser actions**  
- Handling **latency** in navigation  
- Ensuring the system remains **intuitive for first-time users**  

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments
- Built a **working agent that automates browsing tasks** end-to-end  
- Enabled seamless **voice-to-speech interaction pipeline**  
- Created a **transparent, trustworthy interface**  

---

## 📚 What We Learned
- AI agents must balance **autonomy and clarity**  
- Productivity tools succeed when they **remove friction, not add features**  

---

## 🔮 What’s Next
- 🌍 Multilingual support for global adoption  
- 📱 Browser extension + mobile deployment  
- 📝 Advanced workflows: booking, e-commerce, research automation  
- 🤝 Integration with productivity suites (Docs, Sheets, Outlook, etc.)
